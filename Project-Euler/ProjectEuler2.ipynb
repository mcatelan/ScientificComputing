    "For this problem, I begin with the first two entries in the fibonacci sequence. I use those two terms and a while loop to append another term onto the end of our series list. I have a counter, i, that is increased every iteration of the while loop. My counter i helps me specify the index of the previous two entries in series, so that I can add those two entries and append the new value onto series. The while loop also has the condition to execute only when the new term that we would be adding is less that four million. Initially I ran into the problem that the loop would execute one more time than needed because the loop condition was based on the previously created entry. It is important for the loop condition to be based on the value that is going to be appended in order to make sure that the appended value is less than 4 million."
